# demo-ds
OGCIO design system integration using fastify and vite.

## Tech

- [OGCIO/DS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!

## Installation

This requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies for server and frontend and run them respectively.

Fastify server:

```sh
npm i
node index.js
```

Frontend:

```sh
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to see an orange "Apply" button which is overridden to check if SASS works.
